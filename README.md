# FoodBridge---NPO
FoodBridge is an innovative platform designed to combat hunger and reduce food waste through an efficient food donation and redistribution system. The project creates a sustainable bridge between food surplus and food scarcity, making it easy for individuals and businesses to contribute to fighting hunger in their communities.

FoodBridge is an innovative digital platform tackling the dual challenges of food waste and hunger through a community-based redistribution system. The project creates an efficient bridge connecting those with food surplus to individuals experiencing food insecurity, making meaningful contributions to both social welfare and environmental sustainability.

At its core, FoodBridge offers a user-friendly interface where individuals and businesses can schedule food donations through an intuitive scheduling system. The platform supports various donation types—from cooked meals and raw ingredients to packaged foods—and provides flexible pickup options to maximize convenience for donors.

The technology leverages AI-powered food quality assessment through Google's Gemini model, which automatically evaluates freshness, nutritional content, and safety of donated items. This ensures that all food contributions meet quality standards before redistribution, protecting recipient health while minimizing waste.

FoodBridge's network of strategically placed food storage units forms the physical infrastructure of the system. An interactive map helps users locate the nearest donation points, while real-time location services connect donors with collection points efficiently. This distributed approach ensures wide accessibility across communities.

Users benefit from a personalized dashboard displaying their donation history and impact metrics. This gamification element encourages continued participation by visualizing how each contribution helps reduce hunger and environmental waste. The system also supports recurring donations, allowing users to establish regular giving schedules.

The platform fosters community engagement through educational resources about food insecurity and waste, highlighting the environmental benefits of food rescue. Corporate partnerships with major companies like Tata, Google, Microsoft, and Jio provide critical support infrastructure and amplify the project's reach.

FoodBridge's mission draws inspiration from M.S. Swaminathan's philosophy that "The Future belongs to Nations who have grains and not guns," emphasizing food security as fundamental to societal well-being. By connecting donors directly with food distribution systems, the platform eliminates barriers to giving and ensures that surplus food becomes a solution rather than landfill waste.

Through this technological approach to an age-old problem, FoodBridge creates a sustainable ecosystem where excess food finds purpose, hungry individuals find nourishment, and communities find connection through shared resources and compassion
